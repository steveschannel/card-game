# Random Card Game

Welcome!

## Intro

This repository is the result of a challenge I did for Uplift, and it utilizes a stack of React with Apollo Client, working in tandem with Django using Graphene and Postgres, with docker.

### Sample test user

The database is created with a sample test user:

| Name     | Value          |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Username | test           |
| Email    | test@test.test |
| Password | uplifty        |

You can change these in the Django admin if you wish.
